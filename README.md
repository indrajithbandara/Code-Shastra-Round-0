# Treasure Hunt Web App
Built in the one day round of Codeshastra, the web app uses a QR Code Scanner that is used to obtain a clue for the treasure hunt and REST API was used to communicate between the mobile app and web interface.

The web interface is an admin panel used by the organizers to keep a track of the players using their geo-location. It also keeps score of the team based on time.
